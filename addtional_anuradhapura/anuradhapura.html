                <p><b>Anuradhapura...</b> is affectionately referred to as the ‘Garden of Dagobas’. Located in the heart of the Cultural Triangle, this ancient city was documented as the first kingdom of Sri Lanka, dating to the 4th century BC. It was during the peak of this kingdom that Buddhism became the established religion in the country, which is signified by the dominating structure of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya along with other temples and ruins dotted around the historic town. Stroll along the remnants of the past or cycle around the ancient kingdom instead.

However, there is also an inscription to claim that the place of worship was built during the reign of King Gajabahu in the 2nd century AD.</p>

                        <p>Rivalling even the great pyramids of Giza, the gargantuan structure of the Abhayagiri Stupa in Anuradhapura goes back to the 1st century BC. The origins of the stupa are associated during the reign of King Valagamba, when he was initially driven out by the Dravidian invaders. During the time he was fleeing away from the kingdom, a Jain monk insulted him, which made him promise to build a temple in which the monk stood when he regained the kingdom, and that is exactly what the king did after 14 years of exile.</p>

                        <p>Once considered to be the fifth largest monument in the world, the Ruwanveliseya is another ancient stupa that can narrate endless tales of the ancient Kingdom of Anuradhapura. Built by King Dutugemunu in the 1st century BC to commemorate the unification of the entire country after overthrowing the Cholas, this UNESCO World Heritage Site also acts as a place of pilgrimage too. The reason for the stupa to become a sacred place of pilgrimage to many devout Buddhists is the fact that it serves as a part of Solosmasthana and the Atamasthana (The 16 and 8 sacred places the Lord Buddha visited when he arrived to the island).</p>

                        <p>Located in Anuradhapura, Isurumuniya Viharaya was built in the 3rd century BC by King Devanampiyatissa. It was initially called the Meghagiri Viharaya and is believed to be the first temple in which the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Lord Buddha was housed before the capital shifted to Polonnaruwa</p>
                        <p>Apart from being a major place of worship, there are notable features such as the Elephant Pond, the Isurumuniya Lovers carving, and carvings of the Royal Family. It is of course, the Isurumuniya Lovers that take centre stage, as the carving depicts a tragic love story that has been told for centuries and acts as a major turning point for the Sri Lankan monarch of old.</p>
