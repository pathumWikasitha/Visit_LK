                <h2>About Galle</h2>
                <p> Galle is a major city in Sri Lanka, situated on the southwestern tip, 119 kilometres (74 mi) from Colombo. Galle is the provincial capital and largest city of Southern Province, Sri Lanka and is the capital of Galle District.
                    Ibn Batuta, a Moroccan Berber Muslim traveller in the 14th century, referred to it as Qali. Galle reached the height of its development in the 18th century, during the Dutch colonial period. Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by the Portuguese in South and Southeast Asia, showing the interaction between Portuguese architectural styles and native traditions.
                    Galle was known as Gimhathiththa before the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, when it was the main port on the island.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galle">See More</a> </p>

                <h2>History of Galle</h2>
                <p>The city of Galle has a rich and varied history. It was an important trading port for Arab, Chinese, and European merchants, who brought spices, tea, and other goods to Sri Lanka. In the 16th century, the Portuguese established a fort in Galle to protect their interests, but they were eventually driven out by the Dutch, who expanded and strengthened the fortifications. The Dutch influence is evident in the city's architecture, particularly in the Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                   During the British colonial period, Galle served as the capital of the Southern Province.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galle">Learn More about History</a> </p>
