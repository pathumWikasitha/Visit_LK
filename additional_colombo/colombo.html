                <h1>Gangarama Temple</h1>
                <p>This Buddhist temple complex was constructed in the late 19th century. The temple is a place of worship but also looks to educate people about Buddhism. It's also like a museum, as it showcases a lot of physical items, from jewelry to coins and even a vintage Rolls-Royce.

                    You can also view the temple's most sacred religious relic, a lock of the Buddha's hair, as well as a sacred tree around which the temple was built. Visit during the February full moon (called "Poya") to see the Gangaramaya Temple's annual colorful religious ceremony, which includes a procession led by the temple's elephant.
                    
                    The temple complex is in central Colombo not far from Bere Lake.</p>

                <h1>Jami Ul Alfar Mosque</h1>
                <p>While you're in the Pettah area, visit the city's incredible Red Mosque, known formally as the Jami Ul-Alfar Masjid. It was built in the early part of the 20th century and makes quite a statement with its red and white stone minarets, topped with onion- and pomegranate-shaped domes. They tower over the area, and the domes give the building an almost Russian feel to it, architecturally. The style is called "Indo-Saracenic."

                    The mosque is near the port, and its contrasting red and white colors made it a visual landmark for arriving ships. It's especially interesting, as the red and white bricks are arranged in different patterns. Some swirl, some spiral, and other areas have alternating colors with a near optical illusional effect.
                    
                    Visitors, both men and women, are welcome to visit the mosque.</p>

                <h1>Lotus Tower</h1>
                <p>One of the coolest (and highest) places to visit in Colombo is also one of the city's newest things to do. The Colombo Lotus Tower is South Asia's tallest freestanding structure (368 meters/1,168 feet), and a trip to the top rewards visitors with unobstructed views across Colombo and the surrounding cityscape and sea.

                    The tower, which houses a lot of telecommunications equipment, has a telecom museum, a shopping mall (at the base), a revolving fine dining restaurant and indoor and outdoor observation areas. The tower is also a sight to see from the outside - it's covered in LED lighting and presents seasonal themed lighting displays each night.
                    
                    The Lotus Tower, designed to replicate a lotus bulb and flower, simultaneously represents the historic culture of the country and its focus on the future.</p>

                <h1>Mount Lavinia </h1>
                <p>Mount Lavinia is arguably the most popular heritage hotel in Colombo, home to some of the best ocean-view rooms which are almost always booked out, unless you’re an early bird. If you’re visiting Mount Lavinia during festivals or peak season, the hotel offers several attractive deals including wedding packages, sunset deals, national holiday offers and more. The rooftop opens to incredible views of the Laccadive sea, and makes for a quiet little getaway especially during the sunrise and sunset hours. 

                    The well-known National Zoological Garden is also in close vicinity to this legendary hotel. Equipped with a salon, shopping arcade, and swimming pool along with many other facilities, the Mount Lavinia knows exactly how to pamper you.</p>

                <h1>Bere Lake</h1>
                <p>Put together the elements of picnic, adventure and pilgrimage, and you have Beria Lake, one of the most beautiful tourist places in Colombo. Set in the heart of the city, Beria Lake sits in close proximity to the legendary Gangaramaya Temple, while a beautiful temple called Seema Makala temple graces the centre of the lake. 

                The resident temple is furnished with beautiful idols of Buddhist and Hindu deities. Religious appeal aside, the lake is a popular haunt for birdwatchers and photographers, especially during the evenings when a spectacular sunset lights up the sky. Spanning nearly 160 acres, the lake is also famous for rowing and other activities.</p>
